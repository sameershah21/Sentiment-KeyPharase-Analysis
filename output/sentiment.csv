Hopefully, next time I can grace Phoenix with my presence for a little while longer.","Positive",0.58138277865725141

You walk up, choose a form of delivery (burrito, nachos, salad, burrito bowl, etc) you get a choice of meat (chicken, steak, etc) then you chose your toppings (different salsas, lettuce, cheese).  We all know the drill. I will say one thing Qdoba is much better in taste than Kokopellis and Chipotle.","Positive",0.64376178766658465

Mongolian beef, there were more white onions then scallions and it was very bland. Kung po chicken,lots of white meat chicken the whole dish only had one peanut and the taste of this dish was non existent. Very very Blah... Pad Thai noodles,the dish was dry and came out of the container in one giant clump. It tasted like plain noodles, i was glad I had peanut sauce in the fridge to,add to it. Then it was edible .... We will not be going back to G@S.. Very disappointed !!!! From now on it will be Jade palace on 92nd street. For take out Asian! Do yourself a favor go elsewhere!!!","Positive",0.53312864051924425

My favorite is the griefo with pepper jack cheese, hemp cream cheese, guacamole, sprouts, lettuce, black olives, onions, mushrooms, cucumbers, and tomatoes. The hemp cream cheese is to DIE for seriously! I also enjoy the humbolt, which is very similar, and the majic mushroom with sliced portabella mushrooms, teriyaki glaze, green bell peppers, pineapple and pepper jack cheese. The 8inch is soo big but makes a great and filling lunch. You can't beat the prices either. Get the garlic herb bread, it is the best. The only thing I do not like about this place is that the whole ""marijuana"" theme can get old and annoying. This location can also get really really busy and the sandwiches take time to make. Staff is usually pretty friendly and social though. One last thing is that if you eat there or have to wait for a while your clothes will smell like food :/","Positive",0.66149727252483437
